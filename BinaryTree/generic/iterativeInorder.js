/**
 * Given a binary tree. Find the inorder traversal of the tree without using recursion.

Example 1

Input:
           1
         /    \
       2       3
      /   \
    4     5
Output: 4 2 5 1 3
Explanation:
Inorder traversal (Left->Root->Right) of 
the tree is 4 2 5 1 3.
Example 2

Input:
            8
          /   \
            1      5
             \    /  \
             7   10   6
             \  /
          10 6
Output: 1 7 10 8 6 10 5 6
Explanation:
Inorder traversal (Left->Root->Right) 
of the tree is 1 7 10 8 6 10 5 6.
 

Your task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function inOrder() which takes the root of the tree as input and returns a list containing the inorder traversal of the tree, calculated without using recursion.

Expected time complexity: O(N)
Expected auxiliary space: O(N)


Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
1 <= Data of a node <= 105
